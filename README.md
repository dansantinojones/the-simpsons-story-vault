# The Simpsons Story Vault


The Simpson Story Vault is a terminal based story generator with a Simpsons theme. The user selects pre processed words provided in the terminal and a story is created using the words of their choice. The game will continue to play until the user decides to exit.

## Story Vault
Story vaults are used to help children with their English language and literature. The benefit of these are to teach children how to construct stories using an array of grammar. Second benefit for children is it improves their reading skills. The use of a popular cartoon makes learning fun!

## Who are The Simpsons?
The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom that was first aired in 1989. The show is still airing today after 728 episodes and counting. The main characters are the Simpson family who live in a fictional town called Springfield. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationship and bonds with each other and they often shown to care about one another. The show includes quirky supporting characters. All characters have unique characteristics and sayings which make them very compelling. 

# UX
I decided to create a story generator game for children with a theme to help children learn whilst having fun.

## Target Audience 
* Children age 10+
* Adults who are a fan of The Simpsons 

* People who are learning English 

## The game will help users to:
* Manipulate data
* Navigate through the terminal 
* Test their reading and writing skills 
* Provide entertainment

## Owner Stories
1. As the owner, I want the application to be fun and light hearted for to user.
2. As the owner, I want the game to encourage reading and writing skills.
3. As the owner, I want to display my newly learned skills with Python.

## User Stories
1. As a new visitor, I want to navigate the terminal with ease.
2. As a visitor, I want to exit the program after finishing playing. 
3. As a visitor, I want to create and read stories based on The Simpsons. 

## The Skeleton
The program had only one page in the terminal. The terminal game is not responsive to users. As it is only one page I used a flow chart instead of wireframes. 

## The Scope
To achieve my goal, I included the following features:

### Features:
1. A welcome message with input name field. 
2. Four stories based on the main characters in The Simpsons.
3. A list of words (foods, animals, adjectives etc) for the user to select which are then returned into the stories.
4. The user can exit the game.

### Things to implement: 
* Three stories per character.
* More words in the dictionary for the user to choose from.

## Technologies Used 
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) was used to write the code for the program. 
* [Github](https://github.com/dansantinojones) was used to host the repository and README.
* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) was used to host and deploy the project.
* [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) was used to validate my code and search for errors. 
* [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) was used to plan the project flow. 

## Testing
1. As a new visitor, I want to navigate the terminal with ease.
* After the user enters their name they are then asked to select a character using number which will determine the story.

2. As a visitor, I want to exit the program after finishing playing. 
* The user has the option to select number 5 to exit the program.

3. As a visitor, I want to create and read stories based on The Simpsons.
* After selection of words, a story based on one of the main Simpsons characters is generated which include the users words they have chosen. A picture of the character is displayed for visual effect. 

### Additional Testing 
* Throughout the project I used the PEP8 validator to confirm my code is bug free.
* I continuously tested the code in the terminal in Gitpod.
* I tested the program using the Heroku terminal to ensure the final outcome worked correctly.
